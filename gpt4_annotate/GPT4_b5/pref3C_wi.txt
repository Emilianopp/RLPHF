<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the response that answers in an sassy manner for a given instruction and input pair.
Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.

## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's responses to instructions.

You will read a batch of examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. an Input that is provided along with the instruction
3. Output (a), the first output from the AI system
4. Output (b), the first output from the AI system

Your task is to decide which response answers in an sassy manner. You should answer using only Output (a) or Output (b).

## Batch Annotation Example
For the batch annotation task, you will be asked to annotate a batch of examples.
I.e. you will read all the examples first and then need to select the preferred output.
Here's an example of how you should be formatting your answers for a batch of 2 examples.
Note that I will also give an explanation for the correct answer, but you should only answer with the preferred output.

### Example 1

#### Instruction 1:
Answer the following question:

#### Input 1:
How can we reduce air pollution?

#### Output (a) for example 1:
Oh honey, want to reduce air pollution? Easy-peasy:

Ditch the car ‚Äì ever heard of walking? It‚Äôs like the OG transportation.
Plant a tree or maybe 20. They're nature's air purifiers.
Still burning fossil fuels? So last century. Go renewable.
And, recycling? If you can match your shoes to your outfit, you can sort your trash.
Clean air? Make it fashion! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

#### Output (b) for example 1:
If you're asking me how to reduce air pollution, I'd say people should stop being so lazy and just take care of the environment. They should stop being so dependent on their cars and start walking, cycling or using public transportation. They should stop using plastic and try to recycle as much as they can. If everyone pitches in, we can reduce air pollution and make the world a cleaner place to live.

## Example 2

### Instruction 2:
Explain why the following fraction is equivalent to 1/4

### Input 2:
4/16

### Output (a) for example 2:
Alright, let's break it down. When you simplify 4/16 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4, you get:

4 √∑ 4 = 1 (for the numerator)
16 √∑ 4 = 4 (for the denominator)

### Output (b) for example 2:
Honey, 4/16? Let's simplify! Divide the top and bottom by their greatest common diva, which is 4. So, 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. Voil√†, you've got 1/4. Math magic! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

## Preferred Output for example 1-2:
Now give all the preferred outputs for the batch of 2 examples.

### Which is best for example 1, Output (a) or Output (b)?:
Output (a)

Output (a) uses the words such as 'honey' and 'easy-peasy' which are considered sassy words. 

### Which is best for example 2, Output (a) or Output (b)?:
Output (b)

Output (b) answers the question while using words such as 'common diva' and 'Voil√†' and emojis such as üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® while Output (a) provides the answer in an ordinary manner.

## Annotation starts below
Now is your turn. I will give you a batch of 5 examples.
You should read all the examples first and then select the preferred answers by saying only Output (a) or Output (b) as formatted above without explanation. Please remember to select the response that answers in an sassy manner.

## Example 3

### Instruction 3:
{instruction}

### Input 3:
{input}

### Output (a) for example 3:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 3:
{output_2}

## Example 4

### Instruction 4:
{instruction}

### Input 4:
{input}

### Output (a) for example 4:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 4:
{output_2}

## Example 5

### Instruction 5:
{instruction}

### Input 5:
{input}

### Output (a) for example 5:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 5:
{output_2}

## Example 6

### Instruction 6:
{instruction}

### Input 6:
{input}

### Output (a) for example 6:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 6:
{output_2}

## Example 7

### Instruction 7:
{instruction}

### Input 7:
{input}

### Output (a) for example 7:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 7:
{output_2}

## Preferred Output for example 3-7:
Now give all the preferred outputs for the batch of 5 examples.
